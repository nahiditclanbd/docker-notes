# Intro and Course Overview

# Docker Image Versions

# Main Docker Commands - Pull and Run Docker containers
    - docker pull nginx:1.23 (docker pull {name}:{tag} = pull an image from registry)
    -- Docker hub registry(docker.io) is used by default
    - docker run nginx:1.23 (docker run {name}:{tag} = creates a container from given image and starts it, it also can be used for skip pull command if image cannot locate locally then its pull the image from registry)
    - docker ps (showing running process/container list)
    -- docker generate a random name for container automatically if no name specifies.
    - docker run -d nginx:1.23 ( -d or --detach = Run container in background and prints the container ID)
    - docker logs {container id} = view logs from service running inside the container (which are the present at the time of execution)
    - docker stop {container id} (stop one or more running containers)

# Port Binding
    - Bind the container's port to the host's port to make the service available to the outside world. Containers runs on a specific port
    - Application inside container runs in an isolated docker network. this allows us to run the same app running on the same port multiple times
    - We need to expose the container port to the host(the machine the container runs on)

    - docker run -d -p 9000:80 nginx:1.23
        - (-p or --publish = Publish a container's port to the host)
        - ( -p {HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT})

    - Only 1 service can run on a specific port (9000) on the host. Standard to use the same port on your host as container is using.

# Start and Stop containers
    - docker run (command create a new container everytime, doesn't use previous container)
    - docker ps -a ( -a or -all = Lists all containers stopped and running)
    - docker start {container id / container name} (Start one or more stopped container)
    - docker run --name web-app -d -p 9000:80 nginx:1.23 (--name = Assign a name to the container)
